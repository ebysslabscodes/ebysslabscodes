Hi, Im Ron or ebysslabs, even Ebby from my art friends online
I’m currently developing FARMSLiteApp — a lightweight, local-first wellness tracker that helps users 
reflect on their food, mood, and sleep patterns without digital noise, cloud dependency, or data harvesting.

🧠 What I'm exploring:
Python (hands-on learning through real, usable tools)
Flow theory (phi — (Read.Me) won't render the symbol, but you feel it) based modeling
Lifestyle pattern recognition and feedback integration — non-invasive, non-commercial
Conscious system design rooted in repair, not control

🤝 I'm open to:
Creative or speculative collaborations
Ethical science grounded in emotional intelligence
Explorers working at the intersection of biology, alignment, and tech

🔐 Ethics-first approach:
No tracking
No scraping
No user profiling
Built with local-first principles
Designed for awareness, not optimization
Respects emotional autonomy over behavioral manipulation

I build tools that listen, not systems that extract.
Both FARMSLiteApp and HAGx are designed to support — never override.
