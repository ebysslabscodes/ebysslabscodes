Ronald Reed (Ebysslabs)

Independent developer and researcher focused on local-first, privacy-preserving systems that prioritize reflection, stability, and long-term behavior over engagement or optimization.

This GitHub hosts experimental tools and research projects exploring system drift, recovery, and human-aligned design.

Current Work
FARMSLiteApp

A lightweight, offline-first lifestyle app for reflecting on food, mood, sleep, and activity patterns.

No cloud services

No analytics or tracking

No accounts or data harvesting

Data remains fully local to the user

Designed to support awareness and pattern recognition without behavioral manipulation.

CAS 2.0 (Context-Aware Systems)

A research framework for studying system drift, recovery behavior, and long-horizon stability under entropy and noise.

Fully synthetic, reproducible experiments

No training, tuning, or live intervention

Long-run analysis (up to 200k+ steps)

Focused on interpretability and bounded stability

Used to explore how systems degrade, recover, and remain durable over time rather than optimizing short-term performance.

Design Principles

Local-first — no external dependencies

Privacy-preserving — no tracking or profiling

Repair-oriented — recovery over control

Interpretable — systems should explain themselves

Human-aligned — respect emotional and cognitive autonomy

I build tools that listen, not systems that extract.

Collaboration

Open to:

Ethical research collaborations

Speculative or exploratory system design

Work at the intersection of biology, alignment, and technology
